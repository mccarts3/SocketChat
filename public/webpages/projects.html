				<div class="description">
					<p> - The glove controller was a project worked on in my Junior year Embedded
					Systems class.  The goal of this project was to create a wearable glove that would
					connect to a computer to an Arduino via Bluetooth and then allow the user to use the
					glove as a mouse to interact with the screen. I worked with three other engineering 
					students on the project, and my main contribution was implementing an accelerometer / 
					gyroscope Arduino sensor on the glove that would track the user's hand movements. This
					data was then transferred through a Bluetooth sensor to the computer to update the
					mouse position on the screen.</p>

				<a href="https://github.com/mccarts3/VerilogDDR">DDR/Guitar Hero Style FPGA Game</a>
				<div class="description">
					<p> - This project was completed with a partner as part of a Digital System design class.
					We used a DE2 FPGA board in order to output a 4-color Dance Dance Revolution / Guitar
					Hero style game.  The game used the DE2 board's VGA output to display on a computer
					monitor.  Absolute precision was necessary in order to keep track of the notes and display
					the picture correctly.  When the notes reached the bottom of the screen and passed over
					the "placeholder" notes, the user could press a button to keep track of points.
					This work was done in Verilog, something I had never encountered
					before, but we were able to succeed and create two unique levels for our game.

				<a href="https://github.com/mccarts3/AutomaticDrinkDispenser">Automatic Drink Dispenser</a>
				<div class="description">
					<p> - I participated in a group that created an automatic drink dispenser.  Using an Arduino,
					we created a machine that would take in a user's input as to the size of the drink, and a
					peristaltic pump would transfer whatever liquid you wanted into the cup until the chosen
					threshold was reached.  A 12V DC generator was used to power the pump once the user clicked
					a button, and a water level sensor connected to the Arduino determined when the generator
					was turned off again.

			<a href="https://github.com/mccarts3/SecretSanta">Secret Santa Assigner</a>
			<div class="description">
				<p> - This project was initially done as a way to facilitate my fraternity's annual
				Secret Santa event.  I volunteered to organize this for the 90+ members we have and
				saw an opportunity to put my programming skills to good use.  This project has a text
				file with a list of names of an arbitrary length.  A Java program then goes through
				the file and collects all the names, storing them in an ArrayList.  The program then
				randomly assigns Secret Santa partners, being sure not to assign someone to themselves
				before outputting the finished assignments.  This greatly reduces the time/complexity
				spent assigning large groups of people during Secret Santa.</p>

			<a href="">Blackjack / Card Dealer</a>
			<div class="description">
				<p> - This project is ongoing, but some significant progress has been made.  This Blackjack
				game is supposed to deal hands of Blackjack as the user competes against AI in order to win
				money.  So far, the deck will deal and distribute cards while keeping track of each card's 
				numeric value of and name.  Tracking user's money is also complete.  In the future, I plan
				on finishing the different states during each round at adding the AI functionality so that
				the user has several people to play against.

			<h3>Elastic Optical Network Research</h3>
			<div class="description">
				<p> - This past year, I have begun to research elastic optical networks and more efficient
				spectrum allocation using simulator written in C++.  This software was able to test different
				node layouts and system specifications to determine which reservation strategies were most
				efficient with the least amount of failed connections.  Throughout this process, I modified the
				simulator's C++ code either to optimize the code or try different reservation strategies. I was
				able to compare methods such as First-fit, forward & backward reservation, flag-based, and 
				weight-based algorithms to see which is most efficient.  This research is still ongoing.

			<a href="https://github.com/mccarts3/Portfolio">Data Structures and Abstraction Class</a>
			<div class="description">
				<p> - This class was the most intriguing programming class I've taken.  During this course,
				I was able to learn about many different data structures that were vital to programs,
				computer architecture, and company infrastructures.  Using C++, I was able to program
				Linked-Lists, hash tables, stacks, heaps, binary search trees, and graph data structures.
				This code was invaluable beyond my work in programming.</p>

			<h3>Lego Mindstorm Robot</h3>
			<div class="description">
				<p> - Lego has a project called Mindstorm Robots that entail building lego machines around
				a core CPU made by Lego that can have a variety of peripherals including motors and sensors.
				This project had me and three others build a car to navigate a track with obstacles around it.  
				We accomplished	this by attaching motors, color sensors, and proximity sensors to the core CPU.
				We then programmed the CPU to turn on the motors to move either left, straight, right, or back 
				based off what the color sensor and proximity sensor inputs were.  We were able to navigate the
				track for our final project.

			<div class="description">
				<p> - This ion thruster simulator was part of a final project for a class in Electromagnetics.
				I first learned about how an ion thruster operated, and then tried to simulate the force such
				a thruster would create depending on several different variables.  Several key equations in
				the field of Electromagnetics were also taken into account. Once the simulation ran, many graphs
				were generated including the weight of the spacecraft, the speed, the thrust produced, the
				trajectory, etc.

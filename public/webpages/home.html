			<p>My name is Scott McCartney, and I'm a Senior at Miami University.  I am graduating in May 2017 with
			a double major in Computer Engineering and Mathematics.  I decided to make this website as a way to
			showcase some of my abilities and past projects, as well as to convey more detailed information than a 
			r&eacute;sum&eacute; can.  The picture on the left is me with my little brother at his graduation.</p>
			
			<p>As you can probably see, I'm not a graphic designer.  Instead, my interests are in computer engineering.
			Some specific areas include embedded systems, computer architecture, and virtual reality. On this website,
			there are various pages that give you information about some of my past projects that relate to these
			different areas, some contact information you can use to reach me, my school history, and finally a
			simple chat application using Socket.io.
			</p>
			
			<p>This website was written using Javascript, specifically Angular for the page redirects to make them
			more efficient with little to no load time.  Node.js and Socket.io were used to create the chat application.
			This website is in progress, and I plan to add/refine several things in the future.  I've had a blast making
			this and hope to fill it with even more amazing projects in the future.

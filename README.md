# SocketIOChat
### Purpose
This is a personal webpage that attempts to implement and practice my work in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Specifically, this uses:

* Angular.js to dynamically load web pages
* Socket.io to interact between users. This is used in the chat application
	
This is also meant to act as an online resume.

### Features to implement
* Better username input for the chat application
* Ability to keep chat history
* Keep socket when going to other pages on the same domain
* Add information for other webpages

### Known Issues
* If you go to another webpage on the domain and then come back to chat, you must re-enter a username and then messages are duplicated
